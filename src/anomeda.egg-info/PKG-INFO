# Introduction to Anomeda

"Why has the number of visits of our website decreased this week? Who are the users who caused that?" - **anomeda** will help to answer such questions quickly and easily using Python with **pandas** package installed.

You are welcome to visit [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AntonSarr/anomeda) of the project!

**anomeda** is a Python package developed for Data Analysts, Data Scientists, BI Analysts and others. It helps to identify important metric changes and quickly find clusters in data which changed the trend of the metric or caused the anomaly. You just need to pass a `pandas.DataFrame` object to anomeda to start analyzing it.

Let's say your data contains values you want to track in an aggregated or non-aggregated way, like "visit a website" or "purchase" events or rows with aggregated "number of errors per minute" (in anomeda, we call it a ***metric***) and corresponding characteristics, like "country", "device name", "goods category" (we call it ***measures***). If you already know that the metric changed its values and you need to know the reason, with **anomeda** you can run a few lines of code:

```python
import anomeda

normal_period = anomeda.DataFrame(
    data1, # pandas.DataFrame
    measures_names=['dummy_measure', 'dummy_continuous_measure'], # columns represending measures
    measures_types={
        'categorical': ['dummy_measure'], 
        'continuous': ['dummy_continuous_measure']
    },
    index_name='date',
    metric_name='metric',
    agg_func='sum' # function that is used to aggregate metric if more than 1 metric value will be found for a particular set of measure values
)

abnormal_period = anomeda.DataFrame(
    data2, # pandas.DataFrame
    measures_names=['dummy_measure', 'dummy_numeric_measure'], # columns represending measures
    measures_types={
        'categorical': ['dummy_measure'], 
        'continuous': ['dummy_numeric_measure']
    },
    index_name='date',
    metric_name='metric',
    agg_func='sum' # function that is used to aggregate metric if more than 1 metric value will be found for a particular set of measure values
)

anomeda.explain_values_difference(
    normal_period,
    abnormal_period
)
```

This code will iterate over the values of the measures and return a pandas.DataFrame explaining which values of measures caused the abnormal values of your metric and what contribution precisely they made.

> As you might have noticed, anomeda is capable of processing **continous measures**, which means you still can them as measures! It is possible because of automatical discretization mechanism embedded in the package. However, you may pass your own discrete values of continous features.

**anomeda** also lets do the following:
- Detect metric's anomalies
- Find clusters which make the metric increase or decrease (clusters where metric's values have a positive or a negative trend)

See the [Usage](user_guide.md) page of the documentation for the details.
